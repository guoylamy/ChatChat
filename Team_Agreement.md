## Team members

1. Yuchen Yang
2. Yilin Guo

## Responsibilities

We notice that this is a huge project involving design, frontend, backend and deployment, so each of us will participate in each other's work. Here is how we split our work.
We will design the app interface together.

1. Yuchen will be mainly responsible for database schema design, the interaction between frontend and backend.
2. Yilin will be mainly responsible for using React to create Frontend.
3. Yuxin will be responsible for creating HTTP requests and responses and using CSS to polish the app.

This is the brief division of the work.

1. Show respect to each other
2. Meet at least once a week to sync the teamwork and make the following week's plan.
3. Make contributions to the project.
